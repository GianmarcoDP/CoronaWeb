    <p id="summary">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
        coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread
        globally, resulting in the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of
        breath. Muscle pain, sputum production and sore throat are less common. While the majority of cases result in
        mild symptoms, some progress to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The rate of deaths per number of
        diagnosed cases is estimated to be 3.4% but varies by age and other health conditions.</p>

    <h2>Some things you can do during the outbreak</h3>
    <p> Since you can't really go out during these times or hang out at big gatherings like parties you may be wondering what you can do in the meantime. Well, here are somethings I thought up:
        <ul>
            <li>Read: whether they are comics, manga, or full on novels, reading is a good way to spend time.</li>
            <li>Learn: we're probably gonna be stuck in our homes for a few weeks might as well try learning something fun, maybe that insutrument you never have time to learn or maybe try to start cooking</li>
            <li>Watch: probably one of the easiest things to do, just turn off your brain and watch something, whether it be a TV show, YouTube videos, or pirated anime; they're all good ways to pass time</li>
            <li>Play: play some games, playing video games is an easy way to blow off time. Getting lost in their stories or just having fun with your friends, video games are a great way to pass time as well</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>My plans for the coming weeks</h2>
    <p>Other than the classwork we have to do for the next week, and the potential online classes afterwards, I am probably just gonna spend my time watcing YouTube and anime and reading manga in my spare time. It is what I do most of the time in the first place so it's not like mcuh will change for me. If it continues untill Fall, maybe I'll try to learn something new, a language maybe but besides that my plaans are the same.</p>

    <h2>My opinions on COVID-19</h2>
    <p>I think it's pretty serious overall, the rate of severe cases being 20% means hospitals will be too full for other patients as well as more people who have COVID-19. My dad is also apparently taking care of patients who have it now too since he works in the ICU and I live with my grandma so it's particularly bad for her too. Some people are definitely being stupid because of their panic, toilet paper isn't going to run out.</p>
